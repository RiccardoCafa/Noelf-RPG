# Noelf - RPG

All the assets were made from us, except for the music.

The code is written in C# with UWP as limitation setted by our professor, to not use an engine so we could write a lot more of pure C# rather than using a game engine that has built-in functionalities.

In this game, all the monsters are randomically generated, mixing 5 types of animals>

In-game you can access your inventory, equip an item and see it in the equipment view, craft something with the correct items, level up your skills, distribuite your points, see your quests and that stuff that a classic RPG has.
